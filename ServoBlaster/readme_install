Configurations for Rapsberry Pi A/A+/B/B+

In order to install servoblaster, you need to run first clone the project from github and compile the packages:

mkdir -p ~/scripts/c && cd ~/scripts/c
git clone https://github.com/richardghirst/PiBits
mv PiBits/ServoBlaster/ . && rm -rf PiBits
cd ServoBlaster/user
Configurations for Raspberry Pi 2

In order to install Servoblaster on Raspberry Pi 2, download this version of the servoblaster provided by Richard G. Hirst in here. You can do it directly on raspberry by running the following commands:

cd ~/scripts/c
wget -O ServoBlaster-20150219.tgz https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/download/file.php?id=9292
tar -zxvf ServoBlaster-20150219.tgz
rm ServoBlaster-20150219.tgz
2 - Inside ~/scripts/c/ServoBlaster/user folder (or ~/scripts/c/ServoBlaster folder, in case you have a Raspberry Pi 2), comment the line regarding OPTS (OPTS="--idle-timeout=2000") on file init-script, in order to remove the timeout function. Finally, run the following:

sudo make install
3 - To initiate the system with servoblaster out value in ESC's central position, add the following to /etc/rc.local (right before exit 0):

echo 1=150 > /dev/servoblaster
echo 2=150 > /dev/servoblaster
